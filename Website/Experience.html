                      <p>The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) is the public transport agency that operates in the greater toronto area (GTA). There are an estimated 1.7million daily riders that travel with a TTC operated service. There services include the subway, bus, streetcar and paratransit services. My time working there was primarily for customer service for the subway and bus services. This job was my first job in the field, interacting with customers face-to-face.</p>

                      <dd>The primary responsibility for this job, I was hired during a time when the TTC was undergoing construction for certain subway lines for downtown toronto. As a result, they had set up shuttlebuses as an alternative for the regulars. My job was to explain to riders the reason for their rides being cancelled and to direct them to the alternative. Some customers were understandably frustrated, but my experience was a pleasant one as it taught me the proper soft skills necessary in order to work with a customer.</dd>

Each subway line would have a group of people that would be situated around a specific station to do the job. I was assigned the a group's supervisor and as a result I had to keep track of each individual's shifts and rotate breaks accordingly.</dd>

                <p> Affinity Global is an outsourcing collections company that gets contracted out by larger corporations to collect bad debts or accounts payables which were past due. One of the students I was tutoring was able to noticeably improve his academic performance. As a result, a parent of this student offered me a job at the company she was employed in. For my position specifically, the position was at Rogers Telecommunications for the Credit Operations department. The job required use of Citrix systems and I was introduced to the industry practices and terms such as churn, KPI's, retention, and others.</p>

                      <dd> This job was the first time I truly had to deal with upset customers on a consistent basis. Most customers had accounts that were in delinquent standing (past due over 1 month) and were upset that their service was disrupted. Since the goal of the position was to collect from upset customers, soft skills were extremely important as calls were monitored as well. During my time there I was able to consistenly exceed KPI's set by corporate in terms of wait time, hold time, and number of churns.</dd>

                      <dt>Data Entry</dt>
                      <dd>Payments were collected via credit card and amounts were manually inputted at that time. As a result it was extremely important to ensure that data was entered correctly and quickly to reduce the time a customer spent on a call. Furthermore, all calls were logged and representatives were required to make notes of the interaction summarizing the event. I developed a template for notes that was concise and distributed it to peers. This resulted in an improvement of overall KPI's for the members of my team.</dd>
                      <br>
                      <dt>Accounts Receivable</dt>
                      <dd>Corporate would set a monthly quota for individuals. At the beginning it was low, approximately $30,000 per month to be collected; instead with more focus placed on good customer service and efficient call handling. Eventually as the department became more proficient at collections, the quota would be set at $70,000 with commission benefits to those who performed the highest. With this incentive I was able to exert top performance with collections of over $100,000 monthly - an 150% excess of the quota.

                      <dd>A supervisor from another department requested assistance in modelling the current project timeline for the migration from the current system to the new one. I was provided with a timeline of each project phase over the 3-year period and prompted to create graphs and models to visualize the amount of time each phase to take. Within each phase, tasks were also separated by projected time and modelled to show task priorities.</dd>

                <p>IDC Worldsource is an insurance network and 3i Financial investment services is a financial institution. I was hired part time as an administrative assistance, but ended up taking on the roles of a database admin and a business analyst. The reason why this job was under two companies was because I worked under a representative that was part of both organizations, with licesnes to sell both mutual funds through 3i and insurance/investments through IDC Worldsource.</p>

                      <br>
                      <dt>Database Management</dt>
                      <dd>Documents were unorganized in a physical cabinet upon arrival, with occasional uploads onto the company database. I reorganized the the physical cabinets by first removing old documents not compliant with regulations, then through a relational alphabetical organization - main investment holders would contain their own file, along with family members that are registered under them. Afterwards documents were uploaded digitally and organized online in an alphabetical way for easy access and security. </dd>

                      <dt>Business Analysis</dt>
                      <dd>Business performance was monitored monthly in terms of sales figures and number of clients met. Birthdays were regularly kept track of as potential sales opportunities on the day of their birthdays. Clients were organized into categories of health, age, ethnic background, location, and gender for preparation of products or future promotions that they would be eligible to purchase. Payments and commissions from sales were tracked for the business to compare with historical sales figures for the company; previous sales numbers from previous years were set as a target for the current month of the current year. A lot of these analysis were done through excel and RStat for either visualization or quick analysis.</dd>
                      <br>
                      <dt>Regulatory Compliance</dt>
                      <dd>Regulations were strict for both the insurance and mutual fund industries. As a result it was imperative to keep up with regulatory rules and ensure that client information from both companies were kept separate and confidential. Additionally, compliance rules were constantly changing, so action was regularly undertaken to scan and filter the database for non-compliant documents.</dd>
